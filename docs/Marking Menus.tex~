                        % result in citation numbers being automatically
                        % sorted and properly "ranged". i.e.,
                        % [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6]
                        % (without using cite.sty)
                        % will become:
                        % [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] (using cite.sty)
                        % cite.sty's \cite will automatically add leading
                        % space, if needed. Use cite.sty's noadjust option
                        % (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this
                        % off. cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX

                        % Another good source of documentation is "Using

% However, be warned that pdflatex will require graphics to be in PDF
% (not EPS) format and will preclude the use of PostScript based LaTeX
% packages such as psfrag.sty and pstricks.sty. IEEE conferences typically
% allow PDF graphics (and hence pdfLaTeX). However, IEEE journals do not
% (yet) allow image formats other than EPS or TIFF. Therefore, authors of
% journal papers should use traditional LaTeX with EPS graphics.
%
% The path(s) to the graphics files can also be declared: e.g.,
% \graphicspath{{../eps/}{../ps/}}
% if the graphics files are not located in the same directory as the
% .tex file. This can be done in each branch of the conditional above
% (after graphicx is loaded) to handle the EPS and PDF cases separately.
% In this way, full path information will not have to be specified in
% each \includegraphics command.
%
% Note that, when switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the new
% compiler will have to be run twice to clear some warnings.

                        % as IEEEtran.cls normally does. amsmath.sty is already
                        % installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version
                        % and documentation can be obtained at:
                        % http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/



% Other popular packages for formatting tables and equations include:

%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty which improves the
% LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better appearances and
% additional user controls. array.sty is already installed on most systems.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/

% Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools, especially mdwmath.sty and
% mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations and tables, respectively.
% The MDWtools set is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The lastest
% version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/mdwtools/


% V1.6 of IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can
% be used to generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc.


% Also of notable interest:

% Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating (automatically sized) equal
% width boxes. Available:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/eqparbox/



% Notes on hyperref:
% IEEEtran.cls attempts to be compliant with the hyperref package, written
% by Heiko Oberdiek and Sebastian Rahtz, which provides hyperlinks within
% a document as well as an index for PDF files (produced via pdflatex).
% However, it is a tad difficult to properly interface LaTeX classes and
% packages with this (necessarily) complex and invasive package. It is
% recommended that hyperref not be used for work that is to be submitted
% to the IEEE. Users who wish to use hyperref *must* ensure that their
% hyperref version is 6.72u or later *and* IEEEtran.cls is version 1.6b 
% or later. The latest version of hyperref can be obtained at:
%
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/hyperref/
%
% Also, be aware that cite.sty (as of version 3.9, 11/2001) and hyperref.sty
% (as of version 6.72t, 2002/07/25) do not work optimally together.
% To mediate the differences between these two packages, IEEEtran.cls, as
% of v1.6b, predefines a command that fools hyperref into thinking that
% the natbib package is being used - causing it not to modify the existing
% citation commands, and allowing cite.sty to operate as normal. However,
% as a result, citation numbers will not be hyperlinked. Another side effect
% of this approach is that the natbib.sty package will not properly load
% under IEEEtran.cls. However, current versions of natbib are not capable
% of compressing and sorting citation numbers in IEEE's style - so this
% should not be an issue. If, for some strange reason, the user wants to
% load natbib.sty under IEEEtran.cls, the following code must be placed
% before natbib.sty can be loaded:
%
% \makeatletter
% \let\NAT@parse\undefined
% \makeatother
%
% Hyperref should be loaded differently depending on whether pdflatex
% or traditional latex is being used:
%
%\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
%\usepackage[hypertex]{hyperref}
%\else
%\usepackage[pdftex,hypertexnames=false]{hyperref}
%\fi
%
% Pdflatex produces superior hyperref results and is the recommended
% compiler for such use.

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
Clearly, the smartphones are a nice improvement for our lifestyle however it subsists some problems which are strongly linked with the user interface. Indeed, touchscreen phones are not suitable for exploring the different options of the context linear menus and sub-menus. That's why, in this paper, we present a new and revolutionizing approach to explore the hierarchy of menus in a simple and comprehensible way through the Marking Menus. The goal of this project is to design a marking menu widget for Android devices. In the end, the further android developers may utilize the library pourront utiliser la bibliothèque que nous fournirons pour les intégrer dans leur application.

In the novice mode, they offer a tracking gesture and a continuous visual feedback the pop-up menu.
Marking Menus are a specific kind of what is called pie menu (or radial menu).
The aim of this document is to provide the analysis of our Marking Menus' programming for Android's environment but also to present the former results for the benefits of its use. First of all, 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Hand-shape/scheme interfaces offer a very efficient interaction mode. For the purpose of enhance(ing) the interface, Marking Menus allow to 

\subsection{Usability}
This kind of menu is faster than a plain linear menu. It has been demonstrated that it is 3 times faster when the learning process is over. The muscle memory being a form of procedural memory, the body will remember gestures through repetition. The selecting action is then no longer a cognitive one.
To enhance the user experience marking menus follow the Fitts's law. If the distance and the size of an item are optimal, the time to reach it will be small. We are therefore working on a widget holding a great potential in terms of learning speed and efficiency.

\section{User experience}
We let dynamically and discretly the user choose between two modes. The choice will be realize depending on the amount of time the user presses the screen without moving. 
In order to completely understand(ing) the two modes of experience developed in your project, we will see in the following parts screenshot of the menus/sub-menus' browsing and also some explanations.

\subsection{Novice Mode}
The novice is discovering the menus and don't know where to go. The menus are poped-up. The central area is deprived of any component, corresponding of the size of a finger.

\begin{figure}[!ht] 
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{WE.png} %
		\caption{West and Easth}
		\label{WE_schema}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Expert Mode}
After a process of learning, our user masters the novice mode and touTouTouTOUTOUTOUT 1UP ! becomes expert. The expert user can easily navigate in the tree view of the menus.
The expert has the habits of the scheme and can directly draw it without displaying the menu tree.
Nous devons donc approximer le chemin emprunté par l'user.

Put some examples of gesture. 

\section{Constraints and assumptions}
Dans cette partie, il faut parler des contraintes liées à la taille de l'écran qui limitent les mouvements de l'user. 
De l'expert mode avec des problématiques de profondeur de sous menus. prendre en considération ce type de pbs et prévoir des retours au centre. 
That's why, we have made the choice to limit to 6 items per level. Beyond that, it will difficult to decipher the scheme. 
The Google operating system was designed for touched screen devices. Therefore, we have to think about the constraints inhenrent in this sort of environment. 

Par exemple, un exemple de prise en considération de l'environnement final. When we wish to pop the menu at the edge of the screen, we have to applicate an offset which allows to see correctly our widget.
